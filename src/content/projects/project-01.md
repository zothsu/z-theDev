## Project Overview

This site was kept purposefully simple to allow me to experiment with vanilla HTML and CSS, focusing on semantic structure and clean, accessible markup. You can view the live site at nextgendoulas.org.

I designed and built a secure, fast, and user-friendly static website for Next Generation Doulas, a trauma-informed doula service focused on improving access to inclusive birth and postpartum care. The site prioritizes accessibility and mobile responsiveness while offering clear, compassionate content for expectant families. Built with Astro and Tailwind CSS, the site delivers a modern, performance-optimized experience for users and admins alike.

## Technical Challenges

Meeting accessibility standards while delivering an engaging and visually appealing design was a core challenge. I also needed to ensure seamless navigation across devices, implement structured content management with MDX, and deploy reliably using GitHub Actions and SSH to Hostinger.

## Lessons Learned

This project reinforced the importance of accessibility from the very beginning of the design process. I gained deeper experience in optimizing static content delivery, automating deployments, and refining UI for clarity and empathy. It also strengthened my confidence in client collaboration and managing iterative feedback during development.

## Testimonial

> “The website has significantly improved our outreach, making it easier for families to find and access our services.”
