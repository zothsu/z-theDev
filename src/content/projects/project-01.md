## Project Overview

This site was kept purposefully simple to allow me to experiment with vanilla HTML and CSS, focusing on semantic structure and clean, accessible markup. You can view the live site at nextgendoulas.org.

## Technical Challenges

Meeting accessibility standards while delivering an engaging and visually appealing design was a core challenge. I also needed to ensure seamless navigation across devices, implement structured content management with MDX, and deploy reliably using GitHub Actions and SSH to Hostinger.

## Lessons Learned

This project reinforced the importance of accessibility from the very beginning of the design process. I gained deeper experience in optimizing static content delivery, automating deployments, and refining UI for clarity and empathy. It also strengthened my confidence in client collaboration and managing iterative feedback during development.

## Testimonial
