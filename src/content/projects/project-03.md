## Project Overview

Two Sisters Play Cafe is a vibrant café and indoor play space designed for families with young children. I created a straightforward, well-organized WordPress website that showcases the café’s offerings, from its locally sourced menu to birthday party packages and daily hours. The goal was to help busy parents quickly find what they need—whether it’s planning a party or checking open play times.

## Technical Challenges

This project centered on balancing clear content layout with a cozy, playful aesthetic. I customized the WordPress theme to highlight key sections like the café menu, booking details, and FAQs, all while keeping navigation intuitive. Ensuring the content was easy to update for the owners was also a priority, so the backend is tailored for non-technical users.

## Lessons Learned

Working with WordPress reminded me how effective it can be for small businesses looking for easy content management without sacrificing design. I learned the value of prioritizing real-world usability—making sure visitors get the info they need fast and that owners can keep their site current with minimal effort.

## Testimonial

> “The site turned out exactly how we envisioned—easy to use, easy to update, and our customers love how simple it is to find everything.”
