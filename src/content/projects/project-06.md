## Project Overview

The NeuroSpicy Camper is a web app designed to support neurodivergent individuals in finding sensory-friendly camping locations. Built with the MEN stack (MongoDB, Express, Node.js), it lets users document and share experiences at various campgrounds, with a focus on factors like noise levels, crowd density, and overall comfort.

## Technical Highlights

- Created a clean, minimal UI optimized for easy note entry  
- Designed data models to support nuanced campground ratings  
- Implemented robust form validation and filtering functionality  
- Prioritized accessibility and low-stimulation design patterns

## Lessons Learned

This project deepened my understanding of inclusive design and how thoughtful development can directly support user well-being in real-world settings.
