## Project Overview

I developed a sleek, dark-themed portfolio website for Peter Conlin, a Seattle-based 3D cinematic artist and game developer. The site showcases his diverse body of work, including projects like Autonima, Remote Orbit, and Life is Strange: Double Exposure. Emphasizing a minimalist design with orange accents and light tan text, the website provides an immersive experience that aligns with Peter’s artistic vision. ￼ ￼

## Technical Challenges

Creating a responsive and accessible design that complements Peter’s dark aesthetic was a key focus. Ensuring optimal performance across devices and integrating high-resolution media without compromising load times required careful optimization. ￼

## Lessons Learned

This project reinforced the importance of aligning design elements with an artist’s personal brand. Balancing visual appeal with functionality, I honed skills in responsive design, media optimization, and user experience tailored to a creative portfolio.

## Testimonial

> “The website beautifully captures the essence of my work, providing a seamless platform to share my projects with the world.”
