## Project Overview

CakeMoments.art is a minimalist portfolio site designed for a bespoke cake artist who wanted a professional way to showcase their work to existing and potential clients—without worrying about SEO or public discovery. The focus was on creating a private, polished space that reflects the quality of their craft and makes it easy to share a curated gallery on request.

## Technical Challenges

The site was built as a lightweight static site with clean, modular code. Since the client didn’t want to be indexed by search engines, I implemented meta tags and robots.txt rules to keep the site private. We kept the design crisp and image-focused, letting the artwork speak for itself, while ensuring it loaded quickly and displayed well on mobile devices.

## Lessons Learned

This project reinforced the idea that not every site needs to be a traffic magnet. Sometimes, clarity and control are more important than visibility. I also refined my approach to privacy-minded design—balancing beauty and discretion in a way that felt respectful and intentional.
