## <a name="tldr"></a> TLDR

Cal.com is a powerful open-source scheduling platform that rivals paid options like Calendly, with key advantages for small businesses: a free plan packed with essential features, full API access, white-label branding on paid plans, and strict security and privacy compliance. If you need a flexible, customizable scheduling tool that grows with your business and respects your data, Cal.com is your best bet.

## <a name="intro"></a> Open Source Scheduling for Modern Businesses

If you are someone starting a business, you’re likely juggling a dozen things, running operations, managing communication, booking appointments, and keeping everything organized. One of the most underrated tools that can save you time (and sanity) is a good scheduler. Enter Cal.com, an open-source scheduling tool that’s free to start and loaded with features built for growth.

### Why Cal.com Stands Out

#### Open Source and Free

One of Cal.com’s biggest strengths is that it’s open source. This means anyone can view, use, and contribute to its code via GitHub — a win for developers and privacy-conscious users. Small businesses, solo professionals, and artists benefit from a platform that doesn’t gatekeep core functionality. With unlimited event types, calendar integrations, and API access on the free plan, Cal.com gives you enterprise-level power without the price tag.

>While Cal.com is open source, your information is still your own. Cal.com does not sell or profit from your personal data. **Open source means open code — not open privacy**. Your bookings, client information, and integrations remain private and protected.

#### Flexible and Customizable

Whether you're booking consultations, interviews, or events, Cal.com can handle it. You can create multiple types of appointments, set availability rules, sync across calendars, and embed scheduling on your website. As your business grows, Cal.com scales with you — letting you adapt the experience for your clients and your team.

#### White-Label Branding

Branding matters, especially for small businesses trying to make a professional impression. Cal.com’s paid plans allow full white-labeling, including custom domains and UI branding. Even on the free plan, its clean interface reflects well on your brand. With a few tweaks, your booking page becomes a seamless part of your online presence.

## <a name="api"></a>API Integration

One of the most powerful features of Cal.com is that its API is accessible to everyoneeven on the free tier. This is rare in the scheduling world, where APIs are often locked behind expensive enterprise plans. By keeping it open and easy to use, Cal.com gives small teams and solo entrepreneurs the tools to build exactly what they need without jumping through hoops or breaking their budget.

For small business owners juggling a million tasks, the ability to automate scheduling through the API can be a real lifesaver. You can sync appointments with your existing calendar, connect bookings to your CRM, or set up custom email and SMS reminders that feel personal to your clients. These small touches go a long way in saving time and creating a smoother experience — both for your team and the people you serve.

The flexibility of Cal.com’s API also means you're never locked into cookie-cutter booking widgets or rigid workflows. You can embed calendars right on your site, build post-booking automation, and fully control the user experience. This makes it a perfect match for growing businesses that need software to evolve with them.

## <a name="difference"></a>Differences betweem Cal.com vs. Calendly

The biggest difference between Cal.com and Calendly is philosophy. Cal.com is an Open Startup, meaning it publicly shares its metrics and roadmap. That transparency builds trust — something vitally important and often overlooked.

### White-Label Branding & Features Without the Paywall

Calendly places a lot of its more advanced features behind paywalls, such as branding, analytics, and monetization options. In contrast, Cal.com offers these same core tools for **free**:

- Unlimited event types and calendars
- Monetization (like charging for meetings)
- Integrations and analytics
- Full API access and advanced settings

You don’t have to upgrade just to do basic business. That’s what makes Cal.com not just an alternative — but a better solution for individuals and small teams.

Cal.com offers white-label options that let you use your own branding and domain (on paid plans), giving you more control over your scheduling experience. But here’s the real kicker: Cal.com’s free plan offers the same core features most users need — features Calendly often locks behind a paywall.

## <a name="Security"></a>Security

Cal.com doens't just look good, it's secure too. The platform complies with a wide range of glabal security and pricacy standards. These cover everything from international data transfers and healthcare privacy to strong internal security policies and user data rights. But what does all that mean? Let me break it down for you..

### HIPAA

If your business handles healthcare data, HIPAA compliance is a must. Cal.com meets those standards, meaning it can safely manage patient appointments and sensitive information.

### ISO 27001

This globally recognized certification ensures Cal.com has rigorous systems in place to manage and secure data. It involves formal documentation, risk management, staff training, and regular third-party audits to ensure a high level of operational security.

### SOC 2 Type II

The **SOC 2 Type II certification** reflects Cal.com’s long-term commitment to secure and ethical data handling. This certification is based on an independent audit that examines how a company manages customer data over an extended period — focusing on security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy. A Type II report means their practices have been tested and observed over time, not just reviewed in theory.

### CCPA

The **CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act) compliance** ensures Cal.com respects the privacy rights of California residents. This means users can request access to their personal information, ask for it to be deleted, and opt out of any data sale. It also places obligations on Cal.com to clearly communicate how they collect, use, and store user data.

### GDPR

 Cal.com meets strict European Union privacy standards. This law gives individuals control over how their personal data is collected and processed. GDPR compliance means Cal.com must get clear user consent, minimize data collection, support the right to be forgotten, and provide data portability — all while keeping user data secure and transparent.

### EU-US Data Privacy Framework

This framework allows Cal.com to legally transfer data from the EU to the US. Since European law has strict requirements about where data can go, this framework ensures Cal.com handles EU users’ data according to EU privacy standards, even when stored or processed on US servers.

## <a name="thoughts"></a>Final Thoughts

In a world where time is money, having the right scheduling tool makes all the difference. Cal.com delivers where it counts: cost, flexibility, customization, and data privacy. Whether you’re a solo creator, a small business owner, or part of a growing team, this open-source platform gives you the freedom to work on your terms.
