            <p>
              To make your website accessible, follow these key principles: use semantic HTML, provide text alternatives
              for non-text content, ensure keyboard navigation, maintain a logical heading structure, use ARIA roles and
              properties when necessary, and ensure sufficient color contrast. Regularly test with screen readers and
              keyboard navigation to ensure a smooth experience for all users.
